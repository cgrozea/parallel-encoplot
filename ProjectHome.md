Here is the home of the parallel version of the plagiarism detection software Encoplot.
The paralellization is done with the open-source framework SMPSs (and the newer OMPSs) developed at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.
The original Encoplot has won the first international plagiarism detection competition.
